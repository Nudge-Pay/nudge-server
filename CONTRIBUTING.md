# Contributing to Vela

Vela is a Stellar testnet prototype. Start with the project-status section in the README and the curated backlog in [Wave preparation](docs/wave-readiness.md).

## Pick a task

Choose an open issue labeled `wave-candidate`. This is a local preparation label, not a claim of Drips approval. Read its scope and acceptance criteria, then ask to be assigned before starting. Check existing tests first: adding a duplicate assertion is not useful work. Tasks are sized by scope; completion times are not guaranteed.

If working through Drips, apply through its dashboard after repository approval. Maintainers review applications and PRs, check the result against the issue, and resolve accepted work during the active Wave. Rewards and approval are determined by the program; issue count does not establish eligibility.

## Setup and checks

Use the README setup steps. Keep private environment files out of Git, use testnet accounts, and avoid logging credentials or raw provider errors.

```sh
npm ci
npm run prisma:generate
npx eslint "{src,apps,libs,test}/**/*.ts" --no-fix
npx prettier --check .
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run build
npm test -- --runInBand
npm run test:e2e -- --runInBand
```

The test suites mock infrastructure and do not require production credentials. Starting the API or running migrations requires your own local PostgreSQL/Supabase setup; never point test or migration commands at production.

## Pull requests

- Branch from `main` and keep each PR focused on one issue.
- Link the issue with `Closes #<number>` and describe the actual behavior changed.
- Include commands run, results, and any device/network limitations. Do not describe mocked tests as a live transfer.
- For bug fixes, add regression coverage that fails on the original behavior.
- Coordinate changes to the payment payload, API types and authentication across both repositories.
- Preserve historical migration IDs and the deferred RP domain, secure-storage identifiers, NFC MIME type and app scheme until a migration is agreed.
- Use concise, factual commit messages and retain third-party copyright notices.
- Branch protection rules should require the `summary` gate check (`Summary Gate`), which aggregates all workflow dependency jobs and ensures pull requests only merge when every check succeeds.
